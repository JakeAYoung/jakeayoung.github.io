    <p>My name is Jake Young and I am currently attending Pasadena High School where I am enrolled in the pathway program App Academy. I am a very organized and responsible student and enjoy helping people. My favorite class at the moment is App Academy because learning about coding has opened many new doors for a future job. Being a part of App Academy also put me into App Academy classes for Math. The teacher for the class gives many extracurricular activities such as the 1st annual color run and an invite to an American Idol performance. I enjoy working with a team, I work best with collaboration with other people.</p>
