    <p>The non-App Academy project that I chose was a set of slides that I made for my AP U.S. History Class. I chose this set of slides because out of the many slides that I have done in class this was one of the best that I had created on a very important subject. The slides are about how civil rights became major in the 1940's to the 1950's showing the different trials, protests, and speeches. This was a time where many black people protested against white privilege, which led to many arrests on black civilians.</p>
